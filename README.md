### some notes
* for linux use ubuntu 14.04 astra sdk version and install libpng12
* unplug and replug the sensor when its flickering
* on windows make sure to compile godot-cpp with the argument bits=64
* keep in mind that the included astra_sdks have their own license in ther respective folders
* I could not get compiling on windows to work
